      "\n",
      "2. Start an emergency fund: Mothers should consider setting up an emergency fund to handle unexpected expenses or financial emergencies. Having a safety net in place can provide peace of mind and help them navigate any unforeseen circumstances without compromising their financial stability.\n",

      "3. Plan for their children's education: Mothers should prioritize planning for their children's education. This can include setting up a savings account or investment plan specifically for education expenses. By starting early and regularly contributing to these funds, they can ensure their children have access to quality education without incurring excessive debt.\n",
